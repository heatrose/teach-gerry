## Where to Start?

This website is designed to help K-12 and higher ed educators teach about
gerrymandering and redistricting. The site is maintained by MGGG, a team of
mathematicians, geographers, data scientists, and ethicists working on the
problem of redistricting in the United States.


This page contains materials that might help you get started exploring the
interdisciplinary space of redistricting research and teaching. You can navigate
our materials by *topic* under the Materials tab.  We encourage users to adapt
these resources to fit their needs, and share any additional resources at 
[contact@mggg.org](mailto:contact@mggg.org).

## What is Redistricting?

*Redistricting* is the process through which states and local municipalities
redraw political boundaries. *Gerrymandering* refers to one party or candidate
using undue or unfair influence to draw political boundaries that are favorable
to them. States and municipalities take lots of different considerations into
account when they draw districts: from district shape and compactness, to the
interests of resident communities, to the political competitiveness of local
elections. For these reasons, we believe that the study of redistricting and
gerrymandering requires an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together
resources and techniques from mathematics, computing, history, civics,
geography, and many others.
