This is a problem-based curriculum for a semester-long discrete math course, with topics including graph theory, map coloring, apportionment, voting methods, random walks, and gerrymandering. Most of the problems on graph theory, map coloring, apportionment, and voting methods are from [Phillips Exeter Academy's mathematics teaching materials](https://www.exeter.edu/mathproblems). The rest of the problems are by Diana Davis, and others as noted in the text. See below for a guide on how to teach a course using these problems.
