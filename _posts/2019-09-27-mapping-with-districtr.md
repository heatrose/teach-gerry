Using [Districtr](https://www.districtr.org) students can explore redistricting
in a hands-on way, where they get to draw their own plans and the resulting
properties of those choices.

The [districtr user guide](https://districtr.org/guide) details the different
features and how to use them.  In addition, we have a
[activity handout]({{site.baseurl}}/uploads/Districtr-worksheet.pdf) that
highlights some of the important considerations in districting, using Districtr.
