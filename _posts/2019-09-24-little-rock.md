Introduce student to gerrymandering through the lens of public school districts.
Students will compare and contrast the de facto/de jure segregation in Boston
and Little Rock, and then contextualize historical school segregation with 2017
case in Little Rock.

In reflection, students can build their own school districting maps using the 
[Little Rock module](https://districtr.org/new/ar) in Districtr.
The [districtr user guide](https://districtr.org/guide) goes through the 
different features of the site and how to use them.
