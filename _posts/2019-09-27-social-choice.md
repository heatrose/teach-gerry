Social Choice Theory is the study of methods of incorporating many individual preferences into a collective decision. The centerpiece of social choice theory is voting, but it also encompasses problems of compensation and fair division of resources. This course focuses on the mathematical theory of voting, but I will also bring in topics from history, political science, civil rights, political philosophy, sociology, and psychology to provide context for, and explain limitations of, the mathematical approach.
