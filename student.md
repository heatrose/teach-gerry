## I’m a Student

So, you’re a student who wants to know more about redistricting and 
gerrymandering? You’ve come to the right place! We’ve compiled some articles and
videos that we think provide a good introduction to the subject. Feel free to 
check out our other materials in [math]({{site.baseurl}}/math), 
[social science]({{site.baseurl}}/social_science) and 
[computer activities]({{site.baseurl}}/computer_activities) as well.
